// Checked-in mirror of the AMC host's plugin permission surface.
//
// SOURCE OF TRUTH (host repo): Agent Orchestrator
//   src/shared/plugin-permissions.ts — the `PluginPermission` union and the
//   exhaustive `PLUGIN_PERMISSION_INFO` consent map. That shared file is the ONE
//   definition; src/main/services/plugin/plugin-permission-map.ts re-exports the
//   union and maps bridge METHODS onto it, and the marketplace validator keeps a
//   hand-copy in firebase/marketplace/functions/src/types.ts (KNOWN_PERMISSIONS)
//   held in parity by the host's own guard test.
//
// The host consumes the *published* @agent-mc/plugin-sdk, so a runtime
// cross-import is impossible here (and would be circular). This vendored list
// lets the SDK's parity guard fail loudly when the two surfaces drift. When the
// host adds/removes a permission, update this mirror in the SAME change that
// updates the SDK enum, then reconcile the allow-lists below.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// LAST RECONCILED: 2026-09-23, against host commit `b477981a4d` on the host's
// `master`. Its src/shared/plugin-permissions.ts is byte-identical to
// origin/master@a3f3a97aed as of that day (`git diff origin/master master --
// src/shared/plugin-permissions.ts` was empty), so the stt/microphone branch
// noted by the previous reconciliation has landed. Full detail lives in
// HOST_MIRROR_PROVENANCE below, which the staleness guard test reads.
//
// 31 -> 37: added `auth.sharedSignIn`, `boards.link`, `sessions.observeStatus`,
// `chrome.widget`, `documents.read` and `documents.write`, each inserted where
// the host declares it. All six are host-ahead (see HOST_AHEAD_PERMISSIONS).
// Generate rather than hand-copy:
//
//   sed -n '/^export type PluginPermission/,/^$/p' src/shared/plugin-permissions.ts \
//     | grep -oE "'[^']+'" | tr -d "'"
//
// The commit SHA is recorded so the NEXT reconciliation can `git diff` that one
// file between SHAs instead of re-reading 200 lines and eyeballing the delta.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// HISTORY — why this file is worth distrusting. It has now gone stale SIX
// times; the first five were found only because somebody happened to look,
// the sixth by the staleness guard doing its job:
//
//  1. 2026-07-15..27 — claimed 14 while the host union was 19, and claimed
//     `firebase` was "an ungated browser namespace, not a host permission".
//     Both wrong; plugin-bridge-handler.ts hard-denies `firebase` without the
//     permission. Four shipped host capabilities (`tts`, `sessions.readHistory`,
//     `firebase`, `spend`) were unreachable from the public SDK.
//  2. 2026-08-03 — claimed 19 while the host held 22. Missing: `secrets`
//     (shipped 2026-08-01 and advertised in Omniscio v0.1.90), `boards.read`,
//     `sessions.launchAny`.
//  3. 2026-08-04 — claimed 22 while the host held 26. Missing: `launch`,
//     `coreRead`, `oauth`, `channel` — all four Tier-1 `elevated`.
//  4. 2026-08-11 (this change) — claimed 26 while the host held 29. The three
//     `workspace.*` permissions were listed as SDK-AHEAD ("no host
//     implementation exists ... verified across all 80 local and remote branch
//     tips") when the host had in fact landed the whole capability on
//     2026-08-05, six days earlier. `BRIDGE_PENDING_PERMISSIONS` likewise still
//     called `recording` an unwired "gating stub" long after ctx.recording went
//     live. Both were caught only by a full re-audit.
//  5. 2026-08-21 (this change) — the PERMISSION strings were right (29 then, 29
//     now, same members), and everything this file says ABOUT them went stale
//     anyway. It described `workspace.*` as gating 14 methods with no
//     compare-and-swap; the host had since shipped the exec job runner and the
//     mtime CAS, making it 18 methods with a required token on every write.
//     A permission mirror that is correct about names and wrong about what they
//     gate still sends the next reader to the wrong conclusion — recurrence #4
//     was found by someone reading exactly these sentences.
//
//     The new lesson: the count pin (`HOST_PERMISSIONS.length === 29`) could
//     not have caught this, and neither could any assertion in this repo. The
//     drift was entirely in the host's METHOD surface, which no SDK test reads.
//  6. 2026-09-23 — claimed 31 while the host held 37. This time the 30-day
//     staleness guard fired first, on EVERY branch of this repo at once (CI on
//     PR #78 went red on a change that never touched permissions), which is the
//     guard working as designed. Missing: `auth.sharedSignIn`, `boards.link`,
//     `sessions.observeStatus`, `chrome.widget`, `documents.read`,
//     `documents.write` — all host-ahead (the host gates and describes them;
//     the SDK enum has none of them). Re-derived by generation from host
//     master@b477981a4d, byte-identical to origin/master@a3f3a97aed that day.
//
//
// RECURRENCE #4 HAS A SECOND LESSON, and it is the more expensive one. The
// audit that found it first ran against a LOCAL host checkout that was 6679
// commits behind `origin/master`, and that stale tree produced confidently
// wrong findings in BOTH directions — it reported the `documents` bridge
// namespace as SDK fiction when the host ships it, and it reported the
// workspace slice as 9 read-only methods when the host has 14 including writes
// and exec. So:
//
//   VERIFY AGAINST `origin/master`, NOT A LOCAL WORKING TREE. Run
//   `git fetch && git log --oneline HEAD..origin/master | wc -l` FIRST. If that
//   number is not 0, every conclusion you draw from the working tree is suspect.
//
// The mechanism that keeps failing: the parity assertions compare the SDK enum
// against THIS FILE, so a wrong mirror and a wrong enum agree with each other
// and the suite stays green. The pinned count below cannot save you either —
// it is itself part of what goes stale, and it cannot catch a misspelling.
//
// THE RULE: re-derive from the host source when you touch this file, never from
// this file's own prior reasoning, and never by retyping. Generate it.

 *
 * - `boards.read`: gates the host's `boards` namespace and `assembleBoardContext`
 *   (plugin-bridge-handler.ts). No SDK `ctx.boards` type exists yet.
 * - `sessions.launchAny`: gates the `sessions.fanout` method on the EXISTING
 *   sessions namespace (plugin-permission-map.ts) — a method gap, not a namespace
 *   one. The host describes it as "Granted only to built-in plugins", so a
 *   third-party author cannot use it regardless.
 * - `launch` (elevated): gates `launch.open` — "Open links and files, and run
 *   programs you confirm".
 * - `coreRead` (elevated): gates the `core.*` namespace — `core.sessions.list`,
 *   `core.sessions.get`, `core.projects.list`, `core.projects.get`,
 *   `core.messages.list`. A blanket read of all sessions and projects, distinct
 *   from the opt-in, per-session `sessions.readHistory` grant the SDK does type.
 * - `oauth` (elevated): gates `oauth.authorize` — third-party sign-in.
 * - `channel` (elevated): gates `channel.connect` / `channel.send` /
 *   `channel.close` — a live connection to an external service.
 *
 * All six are listed rather than typed on purpose: guessing at a host runtime
 * shape is the exact mistake the HISTORY note above records, and the parity
 * guard already asserts a host-ahead permission has NOT leaked into the SDK enum.
 *
 * Note this is the one allow-list that has never gone stale — all six were still
 * absent from the SDK at the 2026-08-11 reconciliation.
 *
 * Six more joined on 2026-09-23 (recurrence #6), read from the host's
 * PLUGIN_PERMISSION_INFO at master@b477981a4d:
 *
 * - `auth.sharedSignIn` (elevated): "Shared Sign-In".
 * - `boards.link` (elevated): "Attach to your tasks" — links plugin items to
 *   the user's boards; the sibling of the still-untyped `boards.read`.
 * - `sessions.observeStatus`: "Session Activity" — see when sessions start,
 *   finish or need you; never their text. A companion/status-overlay grant.
 * - `chrome.widget`: "Header Widget" — a live status widget in the app header.
 * - `documents.read` and `documents.write` (elevated): "Read your documents" /
 *   "Create, edit and delete your documents". The SDK already types a
 *   `documents` BRIDGE namespace (types/bridge.ts), but neither permission
 *   string is in the SDK enum yet, so a manifest declaring them still fails
 *   `amc-plugin validate` — that is the gap to close, in the same change that
 *   adds them to the enum and the namespace map.

 *
 * Two large deltas were open between 2026-08-05 and 2026-08-11 without ever
 * being recorded here, which is the failure this list exists to prevent:
 *
 * - `ctx.workspace`: the SDK declared 17 methods against the host's 14 — six
 *   pure fiction, three host methods missing, and `writeFile`/`deleteFile`
 *   carrying `expectedMtimeMs` compare-and-swap arguments the host has no
 *   concept of. Resolved by re-deriving `WorkspaceApi` from the host's
 *   WORKSPACE_SCHEMAS.
 *
 *   READ THAT AS HISTORY, NOT AS CURRENT FACT — and note how it reads if you
 *   do not. Four of the six "fictions" (`exec`, `execStatus`, `execResults`,
 *   `execCancel`) and the CAS token are all REAL as of 2026-08-21; the host
 *   built them afterwards. Only the binding pair (`listBindings`,
 *   `requestBinding`) is still fiction, and that one is permanent — the host
 *   deleted the stored-binding model rather than deferring it.
 * - `ctx.recording`: the SDK declared `getShareUrl` and `delete` (neither
 *   exists), typed `stop()` to take a `{ recordingId }` object where the host
 *   wants a bare string, and gave `start()` a `source` option the host
 *   discards. Resolved by re-deriving from plugin-enable.ts.
 *
 * Note `ctx.workspace` was previously excused from this list on the grounds
 * that "the host has no workspace runtime at all". That carve-out became wrong
 * the moment the host landed one, and nothing re-checked it. A whole-namespace
 * gap converts into a shape delta silently — so when a SDK_AHEAD entry lands
 * host-side, re-derive the shape rather than assuming the spec was followed.
 *
 * Append a new entry here (and bump the guard's expected count) only when a
 * fresh, deliberately-deferred type delta is introduced.
